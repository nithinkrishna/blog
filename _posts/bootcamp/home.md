#Bootcamp V.1.0

We expect 3 things from you.

1. __Be rigorous__: Understand how and why your code works. Understand your tools. If you're working with a framework (like Rails or Angular), learning to use it is just scratching the surface. Go deeper. Learn how it works.

2. __Strive for greatness__: You are part of our team because we believe you can be great programmers. But getting there takes a lot of work. We take a lot of pride in our work and strive to be the best. We expect you to do the same.

3. __Don't cheat__: This exercise is designed for you to learn and grow. We are investing our time and efforts to make it worth your while. We expect you to take it seriously.

#POA

* Over the next few weeks you will be given material which will help you grasp the fundamentals of Ruby, Rails and Javascript. We expect you to be absolutely thorough with this material.
* You will be given tests which will validate you understanding of this material.
* We will also give you additional challenges which you if you complete will help your hacker profile.

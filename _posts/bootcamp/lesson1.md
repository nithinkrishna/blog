#Ruby

__Time:__ 15th 9am to 16th Dec 12pm


##What is ruby?

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.


##Why learn ruby?

[This is why](http://www.skilledup.com/articles/4-reasons-learn-ruby-first-programming-language/).


##Why I love to code in ruby?

Ruby is beautiful. The syntax is so elegant, everything are objects. Everything makes sense. The Ruby-way of doing things is so sexy. Ruby gives me immense expressive power. With ruby I can explain to the computer the most complex logic with a few simple lines of code.

##Learning material and instructions

Finish the first three chapters of [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/). Primer, Ascent and Metaprogramming
in ruby. Each lesson has some associated questions. Each course has some associated problems. We expect
you to solve each and every question/problem.

Once you are done with the material and solved all the questions, you will be able to see green tick marks appear after each lesson in the lesson listing page. Take a screen shot of this page and email it to me at [nithin@codebrahma.com](mailto:nithin@codebrahma.com). Also place the solution to [this](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/problems/85-whodunnit) question in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and add the link of the gist to the mentioned email.

We expect this to be turned in by 12pm on the 16th. Get started now.

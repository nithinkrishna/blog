It's been a while since I my last post. I quit my job at [CB](http://codebrahma.com) and came to LA to pursue my masters in Data Science at USC.

It has been quite an interesting past 8-9 months. I've been working on a lot interesting ideas.

Through the summer of 2016, I'll be looking to document parts of my work over the last year in this blog.
